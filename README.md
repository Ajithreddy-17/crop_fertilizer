# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using machine learning models. The system recommends the most suitable crop based on soil properties and climate conditions, and also suggests fertilizers based on the crop type and soil composition.
# Project Overview
The system is built using Random Forest for crop prediction and simple rule-based logic for fertilizer recommendation. The system uses two datasets:
